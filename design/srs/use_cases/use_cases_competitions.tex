\section*{Competitions}

\subsection*{In general (anonymous, independent, pupil)}

\textit{Do unrestricted quizzes.}
Anonymous users, independent users and pupils are able to participate in unrestricted quizzes. Once these users can see the list of unrestricted quizzes, they have to select the desired categorie. When they have selected a quiz, they go to the contest page where they can start the quiz. 

\textit{Answer a question.} 
Once the contest has started, the user can read the first question. Beneath each question, the user may write his answer in the corresponding input box or he can just select the right answer in case of multiple choice. After answering the question, the user will automatically be brought to the next question. 

\textit{Navigate between questions.} 
As stated before, when the users answers the current question, he will be brought to the next question. However, during the contest a user will always see the list with all the questions in the question set of the contest. Each question will be presented with his title. Clicking on one of these titles will bring the user to the corresponding question. The user will also be able to go to the next or previous question by clicking on an arrow. 

\textit{Change answer.} 
Users can change their answer to a specific question. First they navigate to the question as explained before. Then they can see their current answer and if still preferred change the answer. 

\textit{Remove answer.} 
If a user wants to remove his answer to a specific question, he can press a button that will be positioned next to the answer possibilities. This will clean his answer to the question. 

\textit{See time left.} 
During the contest, the time remaining will be shown. This makes it easy for the users to see how much time they've got left. 

\textit{Finish a contest.} 
When a user answers the last question, he will not be brought to the next question. Instead, there will be a finish button that the user can click when he wants to finish. After pressing this button, a warning window will appear stating how much time the user got left and asking wether he wants to review his answers or not. He can then press the cancel button to review his answers or press the ok button to finish the contest. Beneath the list of questions, there will also be the same finish button. This makes it easy for the user to finish the contest when is not answering the last question. 

\textit{See results and feedback after an unrestricted contest.} 
Immediatly after finishing the contest, the user will be shown his results together with the corresponding feedback. On this page he can still see his own answers. 

\textit{See questions that already have been answered.} 
In the list with questions, each question will be marked with some sort of sign to indicate wether the user has already answered this question or not. 

\textit{See how many points that can be gained or lost.}
Just like the time remaining, a user can always see for each question how many points he can win or lose. This makes it a bit more easy for the user to know the importance of each question.
