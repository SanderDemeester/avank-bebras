\section*{6 In case of trouble}

We all know that schools do not always have the most reliable Internet connection and for that matter also not the most reliable PCs. What to do in case of failure?

If the Internet fails (for a long time) during the official competition, then not much can be done. However, the browser will store some information on the answers already given in a cookie on each pupil PC. The value of that cookie can be retrieved by the teacher and then later be sent to the application to serve as a basis for (at least partial) marking.

If a PC fails, then a pupil can move to another PC. Normally the same user is not allowed to take the same competition twice, but in this case the teacher can `reset' a pupil account in such a way that he only needs to log in on the new PC to continue the competition where he left off. And the pupil can even be given some extra `grace minutes' at the teacher discretion.
