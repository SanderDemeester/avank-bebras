\section*{Information stored}
In this section we'll describe what sort of info the application stores.

For each user, we require and store the following information:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Name
\item Gender
\item Month and year of birth
\item Preferred language
\end{itemize} 


We also store the following optional information:
\begin{itemize}
\item E-mail address
\end{itemize}


The registration date and ID is automatically generated and stored.

For a teacher, the email is required, and so is a telephone number (office hours) and address.
\\
Schools require a name and an address. All classes that belong to a school are linked to it.

Classes are defined by a name and have a level and an expiration date (usually the end of the school year). \\

The teachers are linked to the classes they teach and have taught in the past. They are also linked to the restricted competitions they were originator of. Students are linked to the class they are currently in, and the classes he used to be in. Students are also linked to the competitions they took part in and their grades are stored. 
\\ \\
For questions made by the international Bebras committee we also store the official identifier.\\
It is also possible to draw all kinds of statistics from the database.
