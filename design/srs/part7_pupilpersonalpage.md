7 A pupil's personal page
-------------------------

When a pupil logs in, he is shown his personal page. This page contains several items.
  
First of all, the pupil can find here a list of all local competitions he's allowed to do (usually not more than one) and thus opened by the teacher. In the Bebras week, the official contest is also in this list (if the teacher has opened the competition for his pupils).  

Next there is a list of all restricted and official contests the pupil has taken part in lately. A pupil can only take a competition once. For each closed competition, the pupil can obtain his marks, review the questions and
the answers he has given, read the feedback page and so on. He can also see his position within his
class (and a bar chart with the marks for his entire class).  

Like any other user, a pupil can change his password and e-mail address.  

This page is also available for pupils that are no longer connected to a class.
