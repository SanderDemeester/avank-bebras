# Will put in TeX format tomorrow --Jens

For the restricted contests the situation is a little more complicated: in this case the teachers are fully in charge. A teacher may decide to hold a local competition. He starts by creating a new competition using the question sets of contests the organizers have opened to the teachers for this purpose. The contest should have 1 question set for each level that will participate. After the restricted contest is created, the teacher can allow any number of his classes to participate in it. Afterward, statistics will be available for each class individually and for all classes combined. It is possible two or more teachers want to create a contest together. In order to do this, one of them will have to be the originator. He will be in charge of creating the contest as usual, and then inviting the other teachers (using their Bebras ID) to this contest. Each invited teacher can then also allow any of his classes to participate. Before any pupils can start the contest, the originator has to explicitly open it. This does not have to happen at the same time for each class in the competition. As with the official competition, marks and feedback will only be available after the competition is closed, this time by the originator.
