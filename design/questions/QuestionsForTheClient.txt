-After an organizer creates a competition or questionset, is it supposed to be possible/easy for him to still change stuff about it (like change questions). Is the following suggestion acceptable? The creation process consists of two steps: creating and finalizing. If an organizer creates a competition/questionset without finalizing, he (and other organizers) can still change stuff, but no teachers or pupils can see it. If he finalizes it, then people can compete in it (if the organizers open it), but the organizers can't change anything in it anymore. They also can't un-finalize it. A competition/questionset has to be finalized before they can open it. An administrator can un-finalize something, but this would involve kicking any participants out off the competition.

-It was mentioned the questions are on a separate (cluster of) server(s). Is this server (or cluster) accessible to the public, or only accessible from another internal server (such as the one that the application on it). Suppose a question is located in SomeURLorIP/question1, can the computer from a participant reach the HTML page located on that server, or is the application responsible for retrieving that resource and sending it to the participant?
