	\begin{subsection}{Overview}
		These are the subsystems we will use in relation to each other. There is also an
		estimated percentage in each subsystem for how much work each subsystem will
		require.

\begin{section}{Implementation}
	The course of the implementation of each subsystem:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Data:
			Stubs for this (small) subsystem will be created as soon as possible and it
			will be updated when someone needs something from Data.
		\item User:
			The User models will be added as stubs and default implementations. The
			User controller will be created with stubs so that the implementation of the
			following subsystems can also start. After that the shared functionality of
			the users will be implemented and after that each specific user type will
			be taken care of in parallel.
  		\item Management:
  			This subsystem is going to be created after some basic Question Model
  			functionality is available so that is can easily be tested.	
  		\item Question:
  			This can also be created after the basics of User are ready. At first the models
  			will be created and the import from XML features for the questions. After that
  			the management of models can be implemented.
  		\item Competition:
  			When subsystem Question is ready, this subsystem can be implemented. The
  			models will be implemented as stubs so that the dirty data features, views
  			of competition and further implementation of the models can be created in
  			parallel.
  		\item Stats:
  			When the previous subsystems are largely implemented, this subsystem can use
  			them to start adding stats features.
