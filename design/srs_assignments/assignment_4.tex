    \begin{subsection}*{Actions that must be taken by an organiser at the end of each school year.}
    	In our system, an organiser does not have to perform some special tasks at the end of each school year. When a teacher creates a new class, he has to give that new class an expiration date. The experidation date can be the end of the school year but this must not be always the case. After the experidation date, the pupils are removed from their class, that has expired, and will become independent users. The expired class will be added to the list of previous classes for each former student. A daemon will be used to check if a class has expired or not.
